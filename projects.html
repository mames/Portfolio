						<p>It started in a cubicle graveyard.
							We were prototyping our first 20% Team Sprint in April 2009, in which we recruited 3 teams to work on 20% projects for a focused week of development. Since we were bringing together Googlers from different teams, we needed a place for them to co-locate together.


It was impossible to reserve a conference room to hold 15 people for an uninterrupted week, so we called our friends in the Real Estate and Workplace Services team to help us find a corner of unused abandoned cubes in a Google building. We wheeled over chairs from meeting rooms, rolled over all the whiteboards we could find, and borrowed old monitors from inventory. We told people to bring their own mice & laptops and we squeezed in two people/desk to maximize space.

OBSERVATIONS AND INSIGHTS


With an ethnographer on our team, we observed, asked questions and took copious notes to understand the user experience. By the end of the week we identified a handful of key insights:
1. Having a dedicated space for the participants to work together that was separate from their usual desks not only facilitated collaboration with a new team (and between teams); it also removed the normal distractions of their everyday life (like meetings and email), and provided the necessary shift in perspective and environment to enable them to create something new.
2. Elbow-to-elbow seating forced collaboration… people couldn't ignore what their neighbor was working on, so they decided to work more closely together, sometimes pair programming and regularly giving/getting feedback.
3. It was loud. While people were feeding off the energy buzz in the room, teams would seek out abandoned meeting rooms for group huddles and conversations.
4. Engineers wanted machines. If you know engineers: enough said. :)


After the success of our alpha pilot, we decided to do it again! Teams had already moved into the once neglected cubicles, but there were 4 empty offices down the hall that we could use. We had 4 project teams lined up for the sprint, so we went for it.


We returned to the 4 offices a month later for the next round. And again a month later... We kept returning to borrow the space until the space planning team officially declared them ours.


But it wasn’t our ideal space. While individual offices addressed the noise issues from our prototype, we didn’t like being confined by physical walls. It restricted the size of teams, prevented interaction between teams, and psychologically impacted participants. While the rooms helped people focus, they didn’t inspire creativity. It is hard to think outside of the box while being squished into such a tiny box, if you know what we mean. 


BLUE PRINT


So we started to ask ourselves the question: How might we create a physical environment that is conducive to collaboration and innovation?


BUILDING A SPACE FOR COLLABORATION & INNOVATION


INSPIRATION


We met with the Environments Collaborative at Stanford’s d.school to get inspiration and prototype new ideas for how we could build and design a space for innovation & collaboration. (Check out their book Make Space here!)


We visited the d.school in August 2010:


PICS FROM FIELD TRIP[a]


We knew we wanted a big open adaptable space that could be reconfigured to meet an individual or team’s needs. But it was a 2-year journey of prototyping the physical built environment and learning from our users’ experiences and needs. 


THE EVOLUTION OF THE SPACE


[FIND PICS OF THE MANY CONFIGURATIONS]


THE FINAL DESIGN


What did we learn in those 2 years of experimentation and user testing? 


The Garage users transcended 20%ers and 20% Sprint teams. Such a collaborative creative space was in high demand -- for Hackathons, Design Sprints, Beer & Demos, and workshops like the Creative Skills for Innovation Lab. The Garage needed to be designed with flexibility at its core so it could be reinvented to work for all of these awesome use cases we discovered! 


Everything needed to be on wheels so users could cluster desks together to work on a hackathon team, or align them classroom style to facilitate a lecture, or get them out of the way to whiteboard or gather around a demo. We connected a cross-functional team of Googlers from across the organization -- from Search to Learning & Development, from Developer Relations to User Experience -- to collectively design a space for Googlers to create, collaborate, experiment, build, get stuff done, fail, make connections, be a part of a community, and of course have fun and play.


WHAT DID WE BUILD?

We worked with our REWS team to design the ideal movable modular desk -- individually proportioned with a CPU strapped on tight and everything on wheels.

We worked with the architects to build flexibility into the infrastructure of the space -- the network and power cables drop down from the ceiling so you are never confined to an ethernet port or electrical outlet on the wall. Googlers can move their desk almost anywhere in the room and power + networking should be in reach.

We have video-conference enabled projectors up front so we can accommodate lectures, classes and talks and make them accessible to Googlers around the world; and we have monitors in the back for small group demos. 


[PICTURES]


We have a huddle room behind the sliding “Garage door” to enable break-out conversations and meetings. The walls are covered with whiteboard paint and tools so one never has to reach far to sketch up a mock or grab a hammer.

We have filled the room with all the supplies a Googler could need -- from playdough to UI stencils, from whiteboards to demo stations. One should never experience friction between having an idea and building it. 


And if a Googler can’t find the tool or equipment or supplies they need to be productive, we encourage them to order it for the space! We want The Garage to be an environment that is run by the community, so we count on everyone’s active participation and contributions. 


WHAT HAPPENS IN THE SPACE?


The Garage may be an exciting, thoughtfully designed space, but it can only impact collaboration and innovation if people use it. We therefore create meaningful experiences in The Garage to attract, grow and nurture a x-functional community of makers. 


Here is a taste of what we hosted in The Garage within the first month of launch:


To inspire Googlers to dream & build, we launched a Founders@Google series in The Garage, inviting internal and external founders to tell the story of their companies & their personal journeys, and share their approach to innovation, creation, management and design. We launched The Garage with a talk by Astro Teller, Eng Director of Google[x], and went on to host Joel Spolsky of Stack Exchange and the founders or Mission Bicycle Company.

To provide Googlers with the tools to observe & understand their user, define a point of view, imagine all the possibilities, rapidly prototype, collect feedback and iterate, we facilitated 10 hands-on Design Thinking workshops for everyone from new employees to product teams.


[INSERT PICTURES]


To provide the time & space for Googlers to build prototypes of experimental new ideas, we hosted 2 different Hackathons -- each focusing on a different Google API or technology. 
To bring people together and provide a forum for early user feedback, we hosted weekly sessions of Beer & Demos in which Googlers from across the company give 5 minute demos of what they are working on. 


And to enable anyone within the company to use the space, we made it possible to reserve individual or smaller clusters of desks (aka “Parking Spaces”) in The Garage via Calendar; or Googlers can request to book the entire space for workshops, summits, classes and events. 


Users have since reserved The Garage to work on their 20% projects, host interactive design & user experience-related talks, and facilitate team brainstorms & summits. 


In the feedback we collected from users, Googlers commented on the “amazingly cool!” space and its unique “atmosphere” and “vibe.” The open layout “allowed for easy impromptu discussions” and one person said The Garage “feels like it inspires creativity!” 


We are excited to continue to prototype & learn from users and see what the community does with it next.

Within 2 months of our field trip to the d.school, we moved into a SQUARE FOOTAGE space, tore down the cube walls and trucked over T Walls from d.school storage.


What followed was a 2-year journey of prototyping the physical built environment and learning from our users’ experiences and needs to design The Garage from the ground up and launch to Googlers in August 2012.
